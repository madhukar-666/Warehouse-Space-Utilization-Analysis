# Warehouse-Space-Utilization-Analysis

**Project Overview**
The Warehouse Space Utilization Analysis project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of warehouse space usage using Excel. Interns will analyze warehouse inventory data to identify inefficiencies and provide actionable recommendations to optimize space utilization. This project will enhance data analysis skills through spreadsheet functions, pivot tables, and visualization techniques.

**Objectives**

Assess the current utilization of warehouse space.
Identify patterns and trends in space usage over time.
Provide actionable insights to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
**Dataset Description**

The dataset includes key details about products stored in the warehouse, which will be used for utilization rate calculations and profitability analysis.

**Column Descriptions:**

Product_ID: Unique identifier for each product.
Product_Name: Name of the product.
Category: Product category (e.g., Electronics, Furniture).
Warehouse_Location: Specific location within the warehouse (e.g., Aisle 1, Shelf 2).
Section: Section of the warehouse (e.g., Refrigerated, Dry Goods).
Quantity_Stored: Number of units stored.
Unit_Size: Size of each unit (in cubic meters).
Total_Space_Used: Total space occupied (calculated as Quantity_Stored × Unit_Size).
Total_Warehouse_Space: Total available space (in cubic meters).
Utilization_Rate: Percentage of space utilized (calculated as (Total_Space_Used / Total_Warehouse_Space) × 100).
Cost_Per_Unit: Cost to store each unit (in currency).
Total_Cost: Total cost for all units (calculated as Quantity_Stored × Cost_Per_Unit).
Selling_Price_Per_Unit: Selling price of each unit (in currency).
Total_Revenue: Revenue from selling stored units (calculated as Quantity_Stored × Selling_Price_Per_Unit).
Profit: Profit from stored units (calculated as Total_Revenue - Total_Cost).

**Key Findings**:

**Space Utilization**

Overall warehouse utilization rate is 1.75%
Total warehouse capacity is 12M cubic meters with only 0.19M cubic meters (1.5%) currently used
Significant opportunity to optimize space usage

**Inventory Analysis**

Total inventory: 251K units across all categories
Clothing, Groceries, and Health & Beauty categories each have 148 units
Aisle 3 and Aisle 13 contain the highest quantity of stored items

**Financial Performance**

Total Revenue: $6.27M
Total Cost: $1.91M
Total Profit: $4.36M

**Category Performance**

Clothing category generates the highest revenue at $952.35K
Electronics category shows strong profitability at $680.8K (15.09% of total profit)
All product categories show relatively balanced profit distribution (12-15% each)

**Section Analysis**

Perishables section is the most profitable at $1.58M
Dry Goods section follows at $1.45M
Refrigerated section contributes $1.33M to overall profit
